An experimental package, based on protoClasses, that implements a micro
language for developing Bayesian models in R. It aims to be as general as BUGS,
vectorized and fully integrated with R. The model definition and manipulation is
done at the level of plate templates (prototypes) instead of basic nodes as in
BUGS.


It's not yet useful for anyone except me, but I've recently resumed working on
it, and hope to make it alive very soon now.
